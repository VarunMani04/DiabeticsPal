# DS340 Diabetes Prediction Project

This project is a machine learning-based diabetes prediction project. It leverages a Neural Network model to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various features such as age, gender, BMI, blood glucose levels, and more.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure optimal use for machine learning models. Preprocessing steps include class balacing techniques, data encoding, and activity functions for synthetic sampling.
- **Model Implementation**: Our model utilized a Back Propagation Neural Network, along with a SHAP model for explainability
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical analysis are conducted to understand the relationships between the features and diabetes.

## Files

- **`Diabetes_Implementation.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the main implementation of the diabetes prediction model, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv`**: The dataset used for training the machine learning models, containing information like age, gender, BMI, blood glucose level, etc.
- **`diabetes_prediction_implementation.py`**: Python script for running the model predictions and generating output for further analysis.
